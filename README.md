###I'm Nathan! You may know me from my roles as:

#### - Inaugural Google Developer Student Club Alumni for Botswana International University of Science and Technology(BIUST) (2021)

I'm mostly interested in Frontend Engineering and UX Design so feel free to reach out if you're interested in talking about those. Also if you feel like going through some of my public repos definitely do ,although it's a just a bunch of nothing repos of me learning how to code ðŸ˜‚.
